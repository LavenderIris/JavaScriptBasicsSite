            <h2 class="bodyText">Javascript Basics</h2>
            <p class="bodyText">JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. Javascript is extremely popular for a variety for a variety of reasons.
            It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions.  Javascript
            lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic 
            control over them.

            <ul>
                <li><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup
                    holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.  These unique names are called identifiers.
                    <span class="purple">var x;</span> 
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><a href="#">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. 
                    The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class="purple">var x = 10;</span> 
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><a href="#">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types
                    that are JavaScript primitives; Boolean - <span class="purple">true</span> or  <span class="purple">false;</span> null-<span class="purple">null</span> aka nothing; Number
                    <span class="purple">42</span> or <span class="purple">3.14159;</span> String - <span class="purple">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> 
                    Array-<span class="purple">[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object-<span class="purple">{first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe;}</span>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><a href="#">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different
                    code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following 
                    coditional statements: <span class="purple">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="purple">else if</span> to specify to 
                    specify a new condition to test, if the first condition if false; <span class="purple">else</span> we execute this block of code;  
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><a href="#">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but there are all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an 
                    action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop.  That's a loop! 
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><a href="#">Function</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run the code block.  Think of it as a list of 
                instructions.  As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw
                the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions.  Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call
                our function over and over and over again.</li>
